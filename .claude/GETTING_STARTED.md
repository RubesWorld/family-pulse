## What Was Set Up

✅ Created `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Your project context
✅ Created `.claude/settings.json` - Configuration
✅ Created 1 agent(s) in `.claude/agents/`
✅ Created 2 command(s) in `.claude/commands/`

---

## Your Next Steps (10 minutes)

### 1. Customize CLAUDE.md (5 min)

Open `.claude/CLAUDE.md` and fill in:
- Your actual tech stack
- Your project structure
- Your common commands
- Your coding patterns

**This file is 80% of success with Claude Code!**

### 2. Try Your First Request (3 min)

```bash
claude
> @test-agent Analyze current test coverage and suggest improvements
```

### 3. Learn Key Commands (2 min)

Essential commands to know:
- `/status` - Check context usage (run this often!)
- `/help` - See all available commands
- `/clear` - Clear context between features
- `/rewind` - Undo changes if needed


Your custom agents:
- `@test-agent` - Run and analyze tests

Your custom commands (type / and tab to see them):
- `/frontend:component` - Create new component
- `/testing:unit` - Generate unit tests

---

## Tips for Success

### Context Management (Critical!)
- Run `/status` frequently
- Clear context at 80%: `/clear`
- One feature per conversation

### Planning First
For complex work:
```
> Create a detailed plan for [feature]
[Review plan]
> That looks good, implement it
```

### Git Workflow
Always use feature branches:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
# Use Claude Code
git add .
git commit -m "Implement feature"
```

### Review Everything
Claude Code is powerful but not perfect:
- Read the diffs
- Test the code
- Security review sensitive parts

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not updating CLAUDE.md** - This file is critical!
2. **Ignoring context warnings** - Clear at 80%
3. **Working on main branch** - Always use feature branches
4. **Trusting blindly** - Review all generated code
5. **No planning for complex work** - Ask for plans first
